# genetic-algorithm-graph-finder
Finds a function for a given set of mathematical data using genetic algorithms

This is written in Erlang.

Simply compile the .erl files or run the .beam files in an Erlang interpreter of your choice.

Note that this is rather a work in progress. The actual find time is probably measured in years as it stands!
